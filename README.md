# 🎙️ Audio Recording App

Hello! This is my first GitHub project. I made a simple audio recording program with Python.

## 📝 What Does This Program Do?

You can record audio in two different ways:
1. **Time-limited recording** (e.g., 30 seconds)
2. **Manual stop recording** (press 'q' to stop)

It shows a countdown during recording and you can stop anytime by pressing 'q'.

## 🚀 How to Use?

### Required Packages:
```bash
pip install sounddevice soundfile keyboard
```

### Running:
```bash
python Recording.py
```

The program will give you 2 options:
```
1- Continues until you press q
2- Continues for a certain duration
What is your choice? 
```

Choose one and let the recording begin! 🎵
